# Developer Portfolio

This is the code for my developer portfolio, built using `Next.js`.

- While it's a purely front-end project, I learned the basics of React and its associated frameworks with this small kickstarter project.
- I've built my project using GitHub Pages. You can check it out here: https://archishmagoli.github.io/portfolio/
